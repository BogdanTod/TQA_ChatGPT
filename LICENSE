Description:
This Activity Package is a library that uses the UiPath Invoke Code activity to call the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model API with input parameters, including the prompt, model name, maximum tokens, and API key. The workflow validates input parameters and logs relevant information using the Log Message activity. It catches exceptions and throws error messages with the relevant information if there is an error in the API call or JSON parsing.
